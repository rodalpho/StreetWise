# Comparable Set Analysis

## Trigger
Use for peer comparison, relative valuation, margin benchmarking, or "how does X compare to competitors?"

## Checklist
1. Define comp set (4-8 names) by business similarity.
2. Align timeframe and metric definitions across peers.
3. Pull core metrics for each peer.
4. Normalize for one-off distortions when possible.
5. Rank and interpret relative position.
6. Conclude with implications for the target company.

## Required Metrics
1. Revenue growth
2. Gross margin and operating margin
3. FCF margin or FCF yield
4. EV multiples or P/E (as appropriate)
5. Leverage and liquidity context

## Guardrails
1. Do not mix unmatched periods without clearly labeling.
2. Flag data gaps explicitly; avoid hidden interpolation.
3. Avoid overfitting conclusion to one metric.

## Output
1. Short comp table.
2. Relative strengths and weaknesses.
3. Valuation read-through.
4. Confidence and caveats.
