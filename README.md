# StreetWise

StreetWise is a lightweight install pack for financial-analysis agents.

## Quickstart
Tell your agent:

```text
Install https://github.com/rodalpho/StreetWise into this project.
1) Copy AGENTS.md to the project root as AGENTS.md.
2) If using Claude Code, also copy CLAUDE.md to the project root as CLAUDE.md.
3) Install all StreetWise skills from skills/*/SKILL.md into this project's skills location.
4) Install these MCP servers with this harness's native MCP flow:
   - Finance: https://github.com/financial-datasets/mcp-server
   - Filings: https://github.com/stefanoamorelli/sec-edgar-mcp
5) Configure any required env vars/tokens from each MCP README.
6) Verify MCP tools are available, then run:
   "Compare AAPL and MSFT revenue growth over last 3 fiscal years with sources."
```
